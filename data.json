Herein, we established a polarity-regulated derivatization method coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for amino-containing metabolites profiling in the serum samples of patients with gastric cancer and healthy controls, based on our newly designed and synthesized derivatization reagent (S)-3-(1-(diisopropoxyphosphoryl) pyrrolidine-2-carboxamido)-<i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (3-DP-NHS). Enhanced separation efficiency and detection sensitivity for amino-containing metabolites were achieved after derivatization. This method exhibited good linearity, recovery, intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. Only 5\u00a0\u03bcL serum is needed for untargeted analysis, enabling 202\u00a0amino-containing metabolites to be detected. Statistical analysis revealed altered amino acid metabolisms in patients with gastric cancer. Furthermore, ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis quantification revealed increased serum levels of tryptamine and decreased concentrations of arginine and tryptophan in patients with gastric cancer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that an increased tryptamine/tryptophan ratio could serve as a potential biomarker for gastric cancer diagnosis. This study demostrated the possibility of using serum amino acid biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnosis, providing new avenues for the treatment of gastric cancer.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "06", "day": "26"}}, {"article_title": "Appendectomy in Management of Malrotation of Gut is it Necessary?", "article_abstract": "Malrotation is a congenital anatomical anomaly that affects the normal positioning of the intestines.

OSA is a catastrophic problem due to the wide range of health issues it can cause, including cardiovascular disease and memory loss. This review was conducted to clarify the roles of various imaging modalities, particularly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), in the diagnosis of and preoperative planning for OSA. Unfortunately, 2-dimensional imaging techniques yield insufficient data for a comprehensive diagnosis, given the complex anatomy of the airway. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is favored as it more accurately represents the patient's airway structure. Although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can depict the actual 3D airway architecture, their use is limited by factors such as high radiation dose and noise associated with the scans. This review indicates that CBCT is a low-radiation imaging technique that can be used to incidentally identify patients with OSA, thereby facilitating early referral and ultimately enhancing the accuracy of surgical outcome predictions.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "06"}}, {"article_title": "Natural history of Ebola virus disease in rhesus monkeys shows viral variant emergence dynamics and tissue-specific host responses.", "article_abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) causes Ebola virus disease (EVD), marked by severe hemorrhagic fever; however, the mechanisms underlying the disease remain unclear. To assess the molecular basis of EVD across time, we performed RNA sequencing on 17 tissues from a natural history study of 21 rhesus monkeys, developing new methods to characterize host-pathogen dynamics. We identified alterations in host gene expression with previously unknown tissue-specific changes, including downregulation of genes related to tissue connectivity. EBOV was widely disseminated throughout the body; using a new, broadly applicable deconvolution method, we found that viral load correlated with increased monocyte presence. Patterns of viral variation between tissues differentiated primary infections from compartmentalized infections, and several variants impacted viral fitness in a EBOV/Kikwit minigenome system, suggesting that functionally significant variants can emerge during early infection.

Bioinformatic molecular docking prediction and following validation by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) were conducted to explore the binding between ginsenoside Rg5 and 90 kD heat shock protein alpha (HSP90\u03b1). The effects of ginsenoside Rg5 on HSP90-cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) interaction, the client protein stability, and the downstream regulations were further explored. Results showed that ginsenoside Rg5 could induce cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase and enhance irradiation-induced cell apoptosis. It could bind to HSP90\u03b1 with a high affinity, but the affinity was drastically decreased by HSP90\u03b1 Y61A mutation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and ITC assays confirmed that ginsenoside Rg5 disrupts the HSP90-CDC37 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. It reduced irradiation-induced upregulation of the HSP90-CDC37 client proteins, including SRC, CDK4, RAF1, and ULK1 in A549 cell-derived xenograft (CDX) tumors. Ginsenoside Rg5 or MRT67307 (an IKK\u03b5/TBK1 inhibitor) pretreatment suppressed irradiation-induced elevation of the LC3-II/\u03b2 ratio and restored irradiation-induced downregulation of p62 expression. In A549 CDX tumors, ginsenoside Rg5 treatment suppressed LC3 expression and enhanced irradiation-induced DNA damage. In conclusion, ginsenoside Rg5 may be a potential radiosensitizer for lung adenocarcinoma.

Several genes and their regulatory pathways have been discovered due to research into plant-microbe interactions. Previous research on plant-<i>Agrobacterium</i> interactions found that the method of inoculation (wounding using a\u00a0syringe), resulted in altered DNA methylation of the host DNA repair gene promoters. The expression study of host defence genes revealed that the method of inoculation masked the host response to bacteria. It could be possible that these method-induced changes could interfere with various defence regulatory pathways, which otherwise would not be triggered by the bacteria alone. Hence, it would be critical to identify an appropriate method of inoculation that could provide more unambiguous interpretation of studies involving gene expression and regulation in plants under bacterial stress.

In the present study, soybean plants were treated by heterogeneous light after a pre-shading (SH-HL) to simulate the light condition in relay strip intercropping. Gas exchange and nitrogen (N) of leaves were measured to evaluate the photosynthetic performance, as well as photosynthetic N- and water-use efficiency (PNUE and PWUE). Chlorophylls (Chl) and Rubisco were analyzed as representative photosynthetic N components. Results suggest that SH-HL treated soybean exhibited evident photosynthetic compensation as the net photosynthetic rate (P<sub>n</sub>) increased significantly in unshaded leaves, from which the export of photosynthates was enhanced. Under SH-HL, leaf N concentration remained relatively stable in unshaded leaves. While Chl concentration decreased but Rubisco concentration increased in unshaded leaves, indicating preferential allocation of leaf N for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Results also showed that PNUE increased and PWUE decreased in unshaded leaves under SH-HL. Therefore, we suggest that within-leaf N allocation for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in unshaded leaves rather than within-plant N distribution to unshaded leaves drives the photosynthetic compensation under heterogeneous light after a pre-shading.

The toxicity of aluminum (Al) limits the growth and performance of cultivated plants in acidic soil. However, there is limited information available on the relationship between arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the AsA-GSH cycle in host plants under Al stress. This study aimed to examine the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), specifically <i>Funneliformis</i> <i>mosseae</i>, on the growth, antioxidant enzymes, components of the AsA-GSH cycle, and stress response gene expressions in white clover (<i>Trifolium</i> <i>repens</i> L.) under Al stress. Our findings demonstrate that AMF inoculation significantly reduced Al accumulation and increased phosphorus (P) content in the roots of white clover, thereby promoting plant biomass accumulation and mycorrhizal colonization under Al stress. AMF effectively scavenged Al-induced ROS (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), as well as the components of the AsA-GSH cycle (e.g., enzymes and antioxidants) in the leaves and roots of white clover plants. Additionally, the mitigating effect of AMF was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in P transport (<i>PHO1-2</i> and <i>PHT1-7</i>), the AsA-GSH pathway (<i>GST-2</i> and <i>APX-2</i>), and Al stress (<i>ALMT1</i>) in white clover roots compared to control plants.

Huge genetic and phenotypic diversity is present in the apple gene pool, even though, breeding programs have been mainly focused on a few traits of interests, which have resulted in the reduction of the diversity in the cultivated lines of apple. Therefore, the present study was carried out on 70 diverse apple genotypes with the objective of analyzing the genetic diversity and to identify the genetic loci associated with important fruit quality traits. A total of 140 SSR primers were used to characterize the 70 genotypes of apples, out of which only 88 SSRs were found to be polymorphic. The PIC values varied from 0.03 to 0.75. The value of MI, EMR, and RP varied from 0.03 to 3.5, 0.5 to 5.0, and 1.89 to 6.74, respectively. The dendrogram and structure analysis divided all the genotypes into two main groups.

The inferred genetic structure, diversity pattern and the identified MTAs will be serving as resourceful grounds for better predictions and understanding of apple genome towards efficient conservation and utilization of apple germplasm for facilitating genetic improvement of fruit quality traits.

Mean tibial torsion was 48.8\u00b0 (41-63\u00b0), average age was 27\u2009years (18-44), and average follow-up was 30\u2009months (16-45). Nine patients (28%) had a co-existing cam/pincer, and eight patients (25%) had an excessive McKibbin index (51-76\u00b0). Overall, 63% of all patients (including 54% of patients with co-existing pathology) experienced significant hip functional improvement following DTDO alone. Pre-operative vs 12\u2009months post-operative scores were calculated as follows: International Hip Outcome Tool-12-41 vs 67 (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.01); Hip Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living Scale-47 vs 70 (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.05); and Hip Outcome Score Sport Scale-36 vs 64 (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Patients with hip pain frequently present with a combination of tibial and/or femoral rotational deformity and cam/pincer lesions. It is important to consider tibial maltorsion as an aetiology of hip pain.

However, it can also challenge established species concepts and existing management regimes derived from these concepts. Genomic data can help inform decisions about how to manage genetic diversity, but policies that protect identified taxonomic entities can generate conflicting recommendations that create challenges for practitioners. We outline three dimensions of management concern that arise when facing new and potentially conflicting interpretations of genomic data: defining conservation entities, deciding how to manage diversity, and evaluating the risks and benefits of management actions. We highlight the often-underappreciated role of values in influencing management choices made by individuals, scientists, practitioners, the public, and other stakeholders. Such values influence choices through mechanisms such as the Rashomon effect, whereby management decisions are complicated by conflicting perceptions of the causes and consequences of the conservation problem. To illustrate how this might operate, we offer a hypothetical example of this effect for the interpretation of genomic data and its implications for conservation management. Such value-based decisions can be challenged by the rigidity of existing management regimes, making it difficult to achieve the necessary flexibility to match the changing biological understanding. We finish by recommending that both conservation geneticists and practitioners reflect on their respective values, responsibilities, and roles in building a more robust system of species management.

Common sampling methods for sows like serum sampling, and tonsil scraping involve restraining individual sows and are labor-intensive, time-consuming, relatively invasive, and therefore, have limited use in large-scale production settings. Thus, a practical and rapid method of sampling large numbers of sows is needed. This study aimed to develop a new sampling method, named tonsil-oral scraping (TOSc) and compare TOSc to serum and tonsil scraping in terms of PRRSV qPCR detection rate and Ct values in thirty matched sows, thirty days after PRRSV outbreak. TOSc recovered a mixture of oral fluids and tonsil exudates from the sow oral cavity within seconds without restraining the animals. Results showed that, numerically, the TOSc samples had higher PRRSV qPCR detection rate (100 %) compared to serum (16.8 %) and tonsil scraping (73.1 %). Moreover, TOSc samples had lower average Ct values (29.7) than tonsil scraping (30.7) and serum (35.2). There was no significant difference in the detection rate between TOSc and tonsil scraping (Tukey test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.992), while there was a significant difference between serum and tonsil scraping (Tukey test, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), as well as between serum and TOSc (Tukey test, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

In this study, genomic prediction models accounting for incomplete inbreeding in parental lines from two different heterotic groups were developed and evaluated. The models can be used for prediction of general combining ability (GCA) of parental lines from each heterotic group as well as specific combining ability (SCA) of all realized and potential crosses. Here, GCA was estimated as the sum of additive genetic effects and within-group epistasis due to high degree of inbreeding in parental lines. SCA was estimated as the sum of across-group epistasis and dominance effects. Three models were compared. In model 1, it was assumed that each hybrid was produced from two completely inbred parental lines. Model 1 was extended to include three-way hybrids from parental lines with arbitrary levels of inbreeding: In model 2, parents of the three-way hybrids could have any levels of inbreeding, while the grandparents of the maternal parent were assumed completely inbred. In model 3, all parental components could have any levels of inbreeding. Data from commercial breeding programs for hybrid rye and sugar beet was used to evaluate the models. The traits grain yield and root yield were analyzed for rye and sugar beet, respectively. Additive genetic variances were larger than epistatic and dominance variances.

Marine particulate organic carbon (POC) also has high contents of laminaran (42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0% DW). Laminaran shows a diel variation trend in marine algae, the content of which increases in the day but decreases at night. Laminaran also significantly accumulates in the stationary phase of algal growth. Furthermore, the metabolic pathway of laminaran and the remolding carbon mechanism in response to marine nitrogen limitation are proposed and comprehensively discussed. Laminaran production in marine phytoplankton is predicted to increase in future warmer and CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched oceans. Laminaran has diverse biological functions, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, wound healing, and prebiotics. In addition, laminaran is also a major carbon storage compound in marine algae, suggesting its significant ecological function in marine carbon cycle.

This study aimed to evaluate, for the first time, the antiproliferative, antioxidant, anti-adhesion, anti-invasion, and antimalarial activities of phenolic extracts from toasted white and tannin sorghum flours to understand how different phenolic profiles contribute to sorghum biological activities. Water and 70\u00a0% ethanol/water (v/v), eco-friendly solvents, were used to obtain the phenolic extracts of toasted sorghum flours, and their phenolic profile was analyzed by UPLC-MS<sup>E</sup>. One hundred forty-five (145) phenolic compounds were identified, with 23 compounds common to all extracts. The solvent type affected the phenolic composition, with aqueous extract of both white sorghum (WSA) and tannin sorghum (TSA) containing mainly phenolic acids. White sorghum (WSE) and tannin sorghum (TSE) ethanolic extracts exhibited a higher abundance of flavonoids. WSE demonstrated the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> on EA.hy926 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a046.6\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and A549 cancer cells (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a033.1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), while TSE showed the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a070.8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) on HCT-8 cells (human colon carcinoma). Aqueous extracts also demonstrated interesting results, similar to TSE, showing selectivity for cancer cells at higher IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations. All sorghum extracts also reduced the adhesion and invasion of HCT-8 cells, suggesting antimetastatic potential. WSE, rich in phenolic acids and flavonoids, exhibited greater toxicity to both the W2 (chloroquine-resistant) and 3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive) strains of Plasmodium falciparum (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0\u00b5g GAE/mL and 22.9\u00a0\u00b5g GAE/mL, respectively).

Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived A2B5<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte precursor cells (iP-A2B5<sup>+</sup>OPCs) were obtained from mouse embryonic fibroblasts and injected into the lesion sites of SCC rats. Serological testing and magnetic resonance imaging were employed to determine the effect of iP-A2B5<sup>+</sup>OPCs cell therapy.

In 2022, we conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with Syrian refugees in Jordan and used thematic analysis to examine how fathers and mothers (n\u00a0=\u00a015 dyads) enacted parenting together. We identified four approaches characterising how couples navigated coparenting interactions, family cohesion, and intergenerational change. These were negotiation, mirroring, anchoring, and transformation. Specifically, Syrian couples negotiated how to balance responsibilities, sought emotions and behaviours that reflected calm and respect, prioritised family togetherness over education or resettlement opportunities, and, strikingly, adopted gentler parenting approaches to transform intergenerational experiences. Underpinning these four themes were efforts to uphold family dignity. Syrians described themselves as ordinary parents, eschewing the label of refugee parents and building a normal life for their families after war and displacement. Our thematic analysis offers methodological and conceptual advances in exemplifying how to capture a dyadic understanding of coparenting and why refugees strive to parent in ways that sustain mental health and dignity. This systems-level analysis of coparenting in dignity is specifically relevant to strengthening the processes of family-level communication and to designing integrated programs that support caregiving, wellness, and family unity.

When a community lives below the poverty line, unfortunately, it gets deprived of the basic human rights like healthcare, which is a reality to many resource-constrained communities around the world. The number of such resource-constrained communities in developing countries is large. Orphans present a prominent example in this regard in the context of Bangladesh. Orphans suffer greatly from many diseases due to their resource-constrained environment of livings and they are unable to take a minimum care of their own health. Their lack of resources, inadequate literacy skills, and limited (or no) access to technology leave them in such a position that they are ignorant of healthcare services available for them directly or through technological means. Considering all these unavoidable real aspects and the fact that such resource-constrained communities are very little focused in the literature for aiding them in getting bare minimum healthcare services, in this study, we leverage technology and relevant appropriate intermediaries to bridge the gap between the orphans in the orphanages and healthcare services offered by medical doctors. To accomplish so, we conduct a series of field studies over the intended communities. The orphanage teachers and administrators, being in proximity, are the most effective ones to operate as intermediaries for the orphan children, as revealed through our field studies. Therefore, we use these intermediaries to help the orphans to get basic healthcare services via an Android healthcare app called 'Shastho-sheba'.

In this study, we identified five SLC gene subtypes based on transcriptome co-expression patterns of 187 SLC transporters by consensus clustering analysis. These subtypes, which were characterized by distinct TME and biological characteristics, were successfully employed for prognostic and chemotherapy response prediction in colon cancer patients, as well as demonstrated associations with immunotherapy benefits.

Patients with a high SLC score possessed distinct characteristics of copy number variation, genomic mutations, DNA methylation, and indicated an SLC-S2 subtype, which was characterized by strong stromal cell infiltration, stromal pathway activation, poor prognosis, and low predicted fluorouracil and immunotherapeutic responses. Furthermore, the analysis of the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal database revealed that inhibitors targeting PI3K catalytic subunits could serve as promising chemosensitizing agents for individuals exhibiting high SLC scores.

Among current clinical treatments, tumour resection is the most common strategy. It is usually effective but may present several limitations such as multiple operations, long hospital time, and the potential recurrence caused by the incomplete removal of cancer cells. To address these limitations, three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds fabricated through additive manufacturing have been researched for both bone cancer treatment and post-treatment rehabilitation. Polycaprolactone (PCL)-based scaffolds play an important role in bone regeneration, serving as a physical substrate to fill the defect site, recruiting cells, and promoting cell proliferation and differentiation, ultimately leading to the regeneration of the bone tissue without multiple surgical applications. Multiple advanced materials have been incorporated during the fabrication process to improve certain functions and/or modulate biological performances. Graphene-based nanomaterials, particularly graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO), have been investigated both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, significantly improving the scaffold's physical, chemical, and biological properties, which strongly depend on the material type and concentration. A unique targeted inhibition effect on cancer cells was also discovered. However, limited research has been conducted on utilising graphene-based nanomaterials for both bone regeneration and bone cancer treatment, and there is no systematic study into the material- and dose-dependent effects, as well as the working mechanism on 3D scaffolds to realise these functions. This paper addresses these limitations by designing and fabricating PCL-based scaffolds containing different concentrations of G and GO and assessing their biological behaviour correlating it to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) release level. Results suggest that the ROS release from the scaffolds is a dominant mechanism that affects the biological behaviour of the scaffolds. ROS release also contributes to the inhibition effect on bone cancer due to healthy cells and cancer cells responding differently to ROS, and the osteogenesis results also present a certain correlation with ROS.

Tempering with sodium bisulfate (SBS), lactic acid (LA), and citric acid (CA) at 15% w/v alone reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) wheat Salmonella load by 3.15, 3.23, and 2.91 log CFU/g, respectively. Heat treatment (55\u00a0\u00b0C) reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) wheat Salmonellaload by 4.1 log CFU/g after 24\u00a0h of tempering. Combining both tempering and heat treatments resulted in a greater reduction in Salmonella load as non-detectable levels (<2 log CFU/g) of Salmonella in the wheat grains were obtained after 12\u00a0h of tempering with LA (15%)\u00a0+\u00a0heat. A similar result were achieved for both SBS (15%)\u00a0+\u00a0heat and CA (15%)\u00a0+\u00a0heat treatments after 18\u00a0h of tempering. Applying the combined treatments in HRS wheat grains resulted in comparable wheat flour baking (volume, texture, and crumb structure) and physicochemical properties (rheology and composition) relative to the control (tempering with water alone). The results from this study has the potential to be utilized for developing more effective methods for improving the food safety of wheat flour against Salmonella contamination.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "Treatment patterns and outcomes for primary uterine leiomyosarcoma with synchronous isolated lung metastases: A National Cancer Database study of primary resection and metastasectomy.", "article_abstract": "One third of patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas (uLMS) present with distant metastases.

In this study, a facile and green polymer-assisted vacuum filtration strategy was used to prepare cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPhC) films with excellent UV-blocking performance and good transparency. The polymer-assisted self-assembly behaviors of CNC and the hydrogen bonding interaction between CNC, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and graphene oxide (GO) drive the homogeneous distribution and parallel alignment of GO. The UV absorption of GO and high reflection of UV resulting from the chiral nematic structure of CNCs result in excellent UV-blocking and high visible light transmission. Besides, the strong hydrogen bonding interaction among CNC, PEG, and GO endows the films with obviously increased mechanical properties. The UV-blocking and the transparency of the CNC composite films could reach 98.3\u00a0% and 60.5\u00a0%, respectively. Besides, the strain at break of the composite film reached 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0%, which was 535.94\u00a0% of neat CNC films.

We investigated the role of endogenous steroids in the resistance to cancer immunotherapy, as these have strong immunomodulatory functions. Using a publicly available database, we found that the intratumoral expression of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (<i>HSD11B1</i>), which regenerates inactive glucocorticoids into active glucocorticoids, was associated with poor clinical outcome and correlated with immunosuppressive gene signatures in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). HSD11B1 was mainly expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune myeloid cells as seen by immunohistochemistry in RCC patient samples. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors or immune cells isolated from the tumor of RCC patients, we showed that the pharmacological inhibition of HSD11B1 improved the response to the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1. In a subcutaneous mouse model of renal cancer, the combination of an HSD11B1 inhibitor with anti-PD-1 treatment increased the proportion of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells. In an intrarenal mouse tumor model, HSD11B1 inhibition increased the survival of mice treated with anti-PD-1. In addition, inhibition of HSD11B1 sensitized renal tumors in mice to immunotherapy with resiquimod, a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that HSD11B1 inhibition combined with resiquimod increased T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cells by stimulating the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells. In conclusion, these results support the use of HSD11B1 inhibitors to improve the outcome of immunotherapy in renal cancer and highlight the role of the endogenous glucocorticoid metabolism in the efficacy of immunotherapy.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Bonus-based mercenary punishment promotes cooperation in public goods games.", "article_abstract": "Various regions often adopt punish strategies to solve traffic congestion problems.

As an option, we could hire special players whose sole duty would be to monitor the population and punish defectors. The fines collected by various regions will also be used to subsidize the construction of public transportation. Thereby, we derive inspiration, and propose an improved public goods game model based on bonus and mercenary punishment. Research has shown that after cooperator gives the punisher an appropriate bonus, cooperators can strengthen the punisher, thereby weakening the defector's advantage and indirectly promoting cooperation by stabilizing the punisher's position in the system.

In the absence of any simplifying assumptions and when faced with a large number of free parameters, the adjoint method can be an effective and efficient approach to calculating Fr\u00e9chet derivatives and requires just two numerical simulations. In the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment problem, these consist of a forward simulation driven by changes in ice mass and an adjoint simulation driven by <i>fictitious</i> loads that are applied at the observation sites. The theoretical basis for this approach has seen considerable development over the last decade. Here, we present the final elements needed to image 3-D mantle viscosity using a dataset of palaeo sea-level observations. Developments include the calculation of viscosity Fr\u00e9chet derivatives (i.e. sensitivity kernels) for relative sea-level observations, a modification to the numerical implementation of the forward and adjoint problem that permits application to 3-D viscosity structure, and a recalibration of initial sea level that ensures the forward simulation honours present-day topography. In the process of addressing these items, we build intuition concerning how absolute sea-level and relative sea-level observations sense Earth's viscosity structure and the physical processes involved. We discuss examples for potential observations located in the near field (Andenes, Norway), far field (Seychelles), and edge of the forebulge of the Laurentide ice sheet (Barbados). Examination of these kernels: (1) reveals why 1-D estimates of mantle viscosity from far-field relative sea-level observations can be biased; (2) hints at why an appropriate differential relative sea-level observation can provide a better constraint on local mantle viscosity and (3) demonstrates that sea-level observations have non-negligible 3-D sensitivity to deep mantle viscosity structure, which is counter to the intuition gained from 1-D radial viscosity Fr\u00e9chet derivatives. Finally, we explore the influence of lateral variations in viscosity on relative sea-level observations in the Amundsen Sea Embayment and at Barbados. These predictions are based on a new global 3-D viscosity inference derived from the shear-wave speeds of GLAD-M25 and an inverse calibration scheme that ensures compatibility with certain fundamental geophysical observations. Use of the 3-D viscosity inference leads to: (1) generally greater complexity within the kernel; (2) an increase in sensitivity and presence of shorter length-scale features within lower viscosity regions; (3) a zeroing out of the sensitivity kernel within high-viscosity regions where elastic deformation dominates and (4) shifting of sensitivity at a given depth towards distal regions of weaker viscosity.

Understanding where physical property investments have the greatest crime reducing benefits can inform decision making to maximize economic, safety, and health outcomes. This study uses Spatial Durbin models with street segment and census tract by year fixed effects to examine the impact of physical property investments on changes in property and violent crime over an 11-year period (2008-2018) in six large U.S. cities. The units of analysis are commercial and residential street segments. Street segments are classified into low, medium, and high crime terciles defined by initial crime levels (2008-2010). Difference of coefficients tests identify significant differences in building permit effects across crime terciles. The findings reveal there is a significant negative relationship between physical property investments and changes in property and violent crime on commercial and residential street segments in all cities. Investments have the greatest public safety benefit where initial crime levels are the highest. The decrease in violent crime is larger on commercial street segments, while the decrease in property crime is larger on residential street segments. Targeting the highest crime street segments (i.e., 90th percentile) for property improvements will maximize public safety benefits.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Assessment of a deep learning model for COVID-19 classification on chest radiographs: a comparison across image acquisition techniques and clinical factors.", "article_abstract": "The purpose is to assess the performance of a pre-trained deep learning model in the task of classifying between coronavirus disease (COVID)-positive and COVID-negative patients from chest radiographs (CXRs) while considering various image acquisition parameters, clinical factors, and patient demographics.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "28"}}, {"article_title": "The impact of community-based integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health services for youth on population-level HIV viral load and sexually transmitted infections in Zimbabwe: protocol for the CHIEDZA cluster-randomised trial.", "article_abstract": "Youth have poorer HIV-related outcomes when compared to other age-groups.

This study examines epidemiological patterns and factors tied to mortality rates in individuals with psychoactive substance-related mental and behavioral disorders from 1999 to 2020. Methodology This study used a retrospective observational design. The study analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database information, encompassing mortality and population-based data. Data extraction focused on specific criteria such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic location. Descriptive statistics were employed to depict the study population and reveal epidemiological trends. Results The study encompassed data from 239,573 individuals who died due to psychoactive substance use-related mental and behavioral disorders between 1999 and 2020. The overall mortality rate was 3.55 per 100,000 individuals (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.55-3.54) across the study period. Noticeable discrepancies in mortality rates emerged among various geographic regions, genders, races, and age groups. Males (5.32 per 100,000 individuals) experienced notably higher mortality rates than females (1.80 per 100,000 individuals), while the 55-64 age group faced elevated mortality risks (8.24 per 100,000 individuals) compared to the 25-34 age group (1.71 per 100,000 individuals). Significant variations in mortality rates were also evident across different racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions Between 1999 and 2020, the study explored mortality rates in individuals with psychoactive substance use-related mental and behavioral disorders. This analysis revealed variations in mortality across genders, ages (with the 55-64 age group facing higher risks compared to the 25-34 age group), and ethnicities. Notably, males exhibited higher mortality than females. Additionally, divergent rates were observed among different geographic regions.

Lesions are characterized by inflammatory nodules, subcutaneous abscesses, fibrosis, and sinus tracts. Crohn's disease (CD) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Multiple treatment options exist for CD, including monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) antibodies like adalimumab (Humira). Adalimumab is an anti-TNF agent that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HS. A 35-year-old African American male with a history of fistulizing CD presented to the hospital for evaluation of severe pain and purulent drainage from open sores in his bilateral axillary regions, groin, buttocks, and face for four days. He was on adalimumab for two years, during which time he noted the development of Hurley stage III HS. The physical exam was remarkable for a cachectic, painful-appearing male, with multiple abscesses on his lower jaw extending to his upper neck draining thick serosanguinous fluid, with similar findings in his bilateral axillary regions, bilateral groin, and perianal regions. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics consisting of a fourth-generation cephalosporin and vancomycin. While the etiology of HS in this patient is inconclusive, the timing of its development closely aligns with the initiation of Humira and is not a manifestation of CD.

According to the United States Medical Association, approximately 25% of physicians in the United States are now women. Although this progress is evident in the clinical setting, women's representation in academic medicine remains disproportionately low. The underrepresentation of women in academia has various consequences, including limited access to academic resources and hindered career growth. Previous studies have attempted to analyze these disparities, but results have been inconsistent, and the issue's complexity has not been fully understood. This study aims to examine the disparity in the gender of first authors in academic publications related to \" Artificial intelligence (AI) and Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD)\"\u00a0between 2010 and 2023.

There is evidence coming from other countries that homeless people are treated differently in accessing emergency services.\u00a0Examination of ED wait time by demographic characteristics provides pertinent information to identify subgroups that are more subject to the consequences or causes of access block and delayed treatment.\u00a0 Methods We analyzed five years of Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) visit records of the largest tertiary care center in Atlantic Canada. The wait time from triage to seeing a physician was the outcome, housing status was the main exposure, and age and gender were the predictors. Quantile regressions were carried out to identify the influence of homeless visits in meeting the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) wait time benchmarks for each Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) level. The classification and regression tree method was used to quantify and classify the demographic subgroups contributing to wait time disparities across CTAS levels. Results Homeless visit median\u00a0wait times that exceeded the three-hour CAEP benchmark were significantly longer for urgent (by 40 minutes, CI: 25-55), semi-urgent (by 31 minutes, CI: 17-45), and non-urgent (by 57 minutes, CI: 25-89) than acuity level-matched domiciled visit\u00a0wait times. At the 50th percentile, one-hour\u00a0benchmark homeless triaged as semi-urgent waited (median=20 minutes, CI: 12-28) longer, and no other triage-level differences were found at this benchmark. Homeless emergent-level visits that exceeded the three-hour benchmark were 28 minutes, on average, shorter than domiciled patients of the same acuity level. Homeless females above 40 stayed the longest for non-urgent care (mean=173 minutes), 82 minutes longer (p=0.0001) than age-gender-acuity level-matched domiciled patients. Homelessness was the most prominent ED wait time classifier for non-urgent, ED visits.\u00a0Overall, homeless patients triaged as CTAS-5 waited 30 minutes longer (p=0.0001) than domiciled patients triaged as CTAS-5.\u00a0Homeless male 16-20-year-olds waited the shortest time of 72 minutes.\u00a0 Conclusion Homelessness-related wait time disparities exist in the low acuity non-urgent-level ED visits more than in the other levels, supporting the theory that lack of primary care access is a driver of ED use in this group. Our acuity level analysis supports that homeless people of a certain age (older) and gender groups (female) wait longer than their age-gender-matched domiciled patients to be seen by a physician in low acuity level presentations. Given the pattern of the homeless being seen earlier or statistically similar in emergent-level visits compared to matched domiciled patients and that 16-20-year-old homeless males were seen on average within 72 minutes (the shortest mean wait time reported for the triage level CTAS-5), we decline the notion of discrimination at the study site ED.

The patient, a 28-year-old immunocompetent man with no significant medical history, presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute ascending flaccid paralysis that persisted for a few days. His initial symptoms included tingling in his legs, which started at his shin and calf and developed into numbness, which extended to his upper limbs and arms. A CT scan of the lumbar and cervical spine indicated minor L4-L5\u00a0and L5-S1 disc herniation as well as slight bulging in C5-C6 and C7. The patient was discharged but returned to the ED for urgent treatment the next day after he weakened rapidly, losing the ability to walk or maintain balance. Based on his clinical presentation of ascending weakness and generalized hyporeflexia, he was diagnosed with GBS. Abnormal liver function and positive blood tests for anti-cytomegalovirus (anti-CMV) and anti-Epstein-Barr virus (anti-EBV) IgG and IgM antibodies diagnosed hepatitis, CMV, and EBV, respectively. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG; 27 g/day) and antiviral medicine (ganciclovir; 340 mg IV/day) for five days. His nonexistent deep tendon reflexes began to improve two to three days following treatment. He was able to ambulate longer distances with a walker, and his upper extremities regained full strength. This case highlights the importance of a multiple-treatment approach to the treatment of GBS, wherein multiple antigenic triggering factors may be involved.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Readiness for Integrated Care of Older People: A Cross-Sectional Study in Mexico.", "article_abstract": "To evaluate the readiness of the Mexican healthcare system to implement the integrated care for older people (ICOPE) approach into an existing healthcare model.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "The Potency of Invisalign\u00ae in Class II Malocclusion in Adults: A Narrative Review.", "article_abstract": "In recent years, a greater number of adult patients are seeking orthodontic treatment, not only for esthetics but for better functioning and hygiene purposes.

Our results showed that <i>TRIB3</i> exhibits high expression levels across 24 different cancer types and correlates closely with unfavorable prognoses. Meanwhile, <i>TRIB3</i> shows mutations in a wide spectrum of 22 distinct cancer types, with the predominant mutation types being missense mutations and gene amplifications, and significant changes in DNA methylation levels in 14 types of cancer. We further discovered that <i>TRIB3</i> expression is significantly associated with cancer immune-related genome mutations, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) and DNA mismatch repair (MMR), and infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), into the tumor microenvironment.

However, little has been reported about factors that modulate the quantity of secondary metabolites in the plant. In this study, the twin effect of different nitrogen concentrations (0.36, 0.6, 0.8\u00a0g/L) and growing media (LECA clay, peat, vermiculite and silica sand) on plant growth, chlorophyll contents, minerals, proximate and antioxidant metabolites in hydroponically cultivated <i>M. crystallinum</i> was investigated. This is important to determine the dosage of N fertilizer that will optimize the bio-productivity and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and antioxidants in <i>M. crystallinum</i> grown in a hydroponic system. The untreated plant (0\u00a0g/L N) was taken as the control. At the end of the experiment, optimum yields in leaf number (9.2), fresh weight (50.40\u00a0g), Ca, N, and Protein (34.04\u00a0%) were recorded in <i>M. crystallinum</i> grown with peat enhanced with different dosages of N-fertilizer. Likewise, chlorophyll level, dry weight, ABTS/TEAC, FRAP, ADF and NDF contents were optimized in LECA clay treated with N-fertilizer.

In this study, we produce silver nanoparticles from pomegranate wastes, characterized by enhanced antioxidant, anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial properties and investigated their potential to maintain the fruit quality for sixty days in market. The pomegranate waste-mediated silver nanoparticles (PPAgNPs) were spherical shape (measured by TEM), 20\u00a0nm (Zeta sizer), negatively charged -25.98\u00a0mV (Zeta potential), and surrounded by active groups (FTIR). The PPAgNPs scavenged 94\u00a0% of DPPH radicals and inhibited the growth of pathogens, i.e., <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhi</i> and <i>Candida</i> with inhibition zones diameters (16-45\u00a0mm).

Adding single chemical groups, known as fragments, is important for lead optimization tasks, and adding multiple fragments is critical for fragment-based drug design. We have developed a comprehensive framework that uses machine learning and three-dimensional protein-ligand structures to address this challenge. Our method, FRAME, iteratively determines where on a ligand to add fragments, selects fragments to add, and predicts the geometry of the added fragments. On a comprehensive benchmark, FRAME consistently improves predicted affinity and selectivity relative to the initial ligand, while generating molecules with more drug-like chemical properties than docking-based methods currently in widespread use. FRAME learns to accurately describe molecular interactions despite being given no prior information on such interactions.

Although some methods have been developed to detect 5hmC, direct genome-wide mapping of 5hmC at base resolution is still highly desirable. Herein, we proposed a single-step deamination sequencing (SSD-seq) method, designed to precisely map 5hmC across the genome at single-base resolution. SSD-seq takes advantage of a screened engineered human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (A3A) protein, known as eA3A-v10, to selectively deaminate cytosine (C) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) but not 5hmC. During sequencing, the deaminated C and 5mC are converted to uracil (U) and thymine (T), read as T in the sequencing data. However, 5hmC remains unaffected by eA3A-v10 and is read as C during sequencing. Consequently, the presence of C in the sequence reads indicates the original 5hmC. We applied SSD-seq to generate a base-resolution map of 5hmC in human lung tissue. Our findings revealed that 5hmC was predominantly localized to CpG dinucleotides. Furthermore, the base-resolution map of 5hmC generated by SSD-seq demonstrated a strong correlation with prior ACE-seq results. The advantages of SSD-seq are its single-step process, absence of bisulfite treatment or DNA glycosylation, cost effectiveness, and ability to detect and quantify 5hmC directly at single-base resolution.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Association of diabetes and glycemic control with left atrial function: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.", "article_abstract": "Although glycemic status is associated with impaired cardiac structure and function, less is known on left atrial (LA) function across the glycemic spectrum.

Dexamethasone has been shown to regulate inflammation and immune responses in sarcoidosis patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of dexamethasone regulating Th17/Treg balance in sarcoidosis remain elusive. Herein, we elucidated the function role of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in pulmonary sarcoidosis development and explored the underlying mechanism of dexamethasone in treating pulmonary sarcoidosis. We found that the TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 pathway was inactivated in pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. Propionibacterium acnes (PA) induced mouse model was generated to investigate the function of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in vivo. Data indicated that IL17A inhibition with neutralizing antibody and activation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling with SRI-011381 alleviated granuloma formation in the sarcoidosis mouse model. Moreover, we revealed that the Th17/Treg cell ratio was increased with PA treatment in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood. The concentration of cytokines produced by Th17 cells (IL-17A, IL-23) was up-regulated in the BALF of PA-treated mice, while those produced by Tregs (IL-10, TGF-\u03b21) presented significant reduction. The treatment of IL-17A neutralizing antibody or SRI-011381 was demonstrated to rescue the PA-induced changes in the concentration of IL-17A, IL-23, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b21. Additionally, we demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment activated the TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in the lung tissues of pulmonary sarcoidosis mice. Dexamethasone was also revealed to promote the rebalancing of the Th17/Treg ratio and attenuated the granuloma formation in pulmonary sarcoidosis. In conclusion, dexamethasone activates the TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and induces Th17/Treg rebalance, alleviating pulmonary sarcoidosis, which suggests the potential of dexamethasone in treating pulmonary sarcoidosis.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "[Advantages of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A review].", "article_abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (arGLP1) are an effective treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), mainly due to increasing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release by stimulating the respective receptors.

Aim To evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of using computer-based simulation\u00a0tools for teaching gross anatomy via online mode to undergraduate medical students. Methodology A prospective crossover randomized controlled study was conducted online on 200 (120 males (60%) and 80 females (40%), Year 1 medical undergraduates (mean age males: 19.67 years and females: 19.52 years), wherein two broad topics of head and neck region were taught by didactic lectures delivered online via Zoom. Dissection videos were prepared for both cadaveric and computer-based simulation teaching. Groups were divided by random allocation and pre- and post-tests and feedback surveys were conducted online. Results A significant increase from pre- to post-test scores was found in both cadaveric and computer-based simulation techniques. However, more change was found in the computer technique as its t-value was more than the cadaveric technique. The feedback from the students was that the computer-based simulation teaching method gave them a good insight into 3D understanding of the human body, increased understanding of relations of body structures and capacity to grasp surface anatomy.

Some studies implemented patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps. Other studies explored non-pharmacological interventions like magnetic acupuncture. The results showed a reduction in the need for postoperative analgesics in patients treated with LA, particularly when using non-opioid medications and novel analgesic techniques. Pediatric patients who received gabapentin reported lower opioid use, shorter hospital stays, and high satisfaction rates. However, the reliance on opioids remained significant in some cases, particularly among patients with peritonitis who required more morphine. Pain management in pediatric patients is multifaceted, involving preoperative and postoperative analgesics, nerve blocks, and PCA pumps. Efforts to improve pain management following pediatric LA while reducing opioid reliance are essential in the context of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The findings from this study highlight the potential benefits of non-opioid analgesics, nerve blocks, and alternative methods for managing postoperative pain in <18 appendectomy patients. Further research and standardization of pain management protocols are needed to ensure optimal patient outcomes and minimize the risk of opioid-related complications.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "28"}}, {"article_title": "Antibiotics Knowledge, Usage, and Prescription Patterns Among Dental Practitioners in Hyderabad, South India.", "article_abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a pertinent issue in the healthcare sector, accounting for 1.27 million patient deaths worldwide.

A multidisciplinary approach is key to ensuring the efficiency and safety of the surgical process, with the anesthesia team, nursing, surgeon, and healthcare facilities all playing a role. The purpose of this study is to capture potential associations between the anesthesiologists' case volume and patient postoperative outcomes in the early recovery period. Methods A retrospective review of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), lumbar decompression (LD), and lumbar fusion (LF) patients from July 2019 to June 2023 was performed. Anesthesiologists were categorized into low, medium, and high volumes of spine surgical cases. Univariate analysis was performed on patient demographics, intraoperative measures, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) measures, and postoperative measures by anesthesiologist volume. Results This study included 545 ACDF, 815 LD, and 1,144 LF patients. There were no differences between groups in ACDF patients by anesthesiologist volume. When examining patients undergoing LD, there was a difference in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of three or greater (low volume: 41.7% vs. medium volume: 53.7% vs. high volume: 45.0%; p=0.029). When examining patients undergoing LF, there were differences in patients with low temperatures in PACU (low volume: 2.8% vs. medium volume: 7.3% vs. high volume: 4.2%; p=0.044) and the percentage of patients with a 90-day emergency department return (low volume: 7.7% vs. medium volume: 11.9% vs. high volume: 7.0%; p=0.024). Conclusion While this study found a minimal impact of anesthesiologist volume on postoperative outcomes, recent literature has emphasized the critical role of teamwork and specialized surgical teams to enhance efficiency and patient care.

Recent studies have shown that treating water with magnets can alter its physicochemical\u00a0properties, including intracluster bonds and water-ion interactions. Magnetized water also undergoes modifications in its physicochemical characteristics, such as pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. While there is a significant amount of literature on the use of magnetized water in agricultural settings, research on its potential biomedical applications is still limited. Based on previous findings indicating a potential relationship between autophagy activation and hair loss reversal, a pilot study was designed to explore the effects of topically applied magnetized saline water in patients with androgenetic alopecia. The hypothesis was that the process of water magnetization, which promotes the creation of hydroxyl ions, could potentially induce hair growth through the induction of alkali-induced autophagy in the scalp. Methods We recruited 20 Caucasian men with mild-to-moderate androgenetic alopecia (Norwood-Hamilton stages II-III). Initially, we conducted a 12-week open-label study to evaluate the potential of a topical lotion containing 95% magnetized saline water (2 mL applied once daily) to increase hair count and hair mass index (HMI). Subsequently, we investigated the effect of the lotion on two autophagy markers (Beclin-1 and LC3B) in scalp biopsies from a subgroup of 10 men. Results Hair count significantly increased after 12 weeks of topical treatment with magnetized saline water (from 20.6 \u00b1 9.8 at baseline to 32.5 \u00b1 12.4 at 12 weeks, P < 0.001). Similarly, the mean HMI increased from 37.8 \u00b1 11.4 at baseline to 45.1 \u00b1 13.6 at 12 weeks (P < 0.01). At the molecular level, the topical lotion effectively increased Beclin-1 levels in scalp biopsies by 44% at 12 weeks as compared to the baseline. Similarly, LC3B levels increased by 36% from baseline to 12 weeks, indicating that the lotion effectively activated autophagy in the scalp.

We describe a case series of PRES with hemorrhagic features. Subjects and methods Electronic medical records of hospitalized patients diagnosed with PRES from January 2009 to December 2021 were collected. Demographic data, medical history, clinical presentation, and outcome were recorded. Variables were compared between patients with and without hemorrhagic features using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with a statistical significance level of p<0.05. Results Over a 12-year period, 33 patients were diagnosed with PRES, of whom 10 had hemorrhagic features: seven cortical microbleeds, two intraparenchymal hematomas, and one subarachnoid hemorrhage. Half of the patients were women, with a median age of 45.8 years (interquartile range (IQR) 21.8), and were admitted for non-neurological reasons. The sample included nine transplant recipients (six solid organa, three bone marrowa), with four patients in the immediate post-transplant period. PRES occurred in the context of infections and blood pressure fluctuations under cytotoxic drugs, such as immunosuppressants. Seventy percent showed improvement/resolution on neuroimaging at a median of 70 days (IQR 62.9). The three major hemorrhages occurred in the context of thrombocytopenia.

This condition is usually identified through the manual evaluation of orthopantomogram (OPG) images, which is time-consuming and can have interobserver variability. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is gaining importance and interest in recent years. The application of AI in detecting styloid process elongation is less explored, advocating for research in the same arena. Aim and objectives The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence in detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs and to compare the performance of the three different AI algorithms with that of the manual radiographic evaluation by the radiologist. Materials and methods A total of 400 digital OPGs were screened, and linear measurements of the styloid process length (ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Maryland, USA)) were done for the identification of styloid process elongation by a single calibrated observer to finally include a processed image dataset including 169 images of the elongated styloid process and 200 images of the normal styloid process.\u00a0A machine learning approach was used to detect the styloid process elongation using the three different AI models: logistic regression, neural network, and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms in Orange software (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). Performance evaluation was done using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve. Results Logistic regression and neural network algorithms depicted the highest accuracy of 100% with no false positives or false negatives, securing a score of 1.000 for all the metrics.\u00a0However, the Na\u00efve Bayes model demonstrated a fairly considerable accuracy, classifying 49 false positive images and 59 false negative images with an AUC (area under the curve) score of 78 %.

However, it remains unclear whether such an end-to-end approach can achieve problem-solving performance on par with experienced chemists without fully revealing insights into the chemical mechanisms involved. Moreover, there is a lack of unified and chemically inspired frameworks for improving multitask reaction predictions in this area. In this study, we have addressed these challenges by investigating the impact of fine-grained reaction-type labels on multiple downstream tasks and propose a novel framework named SynCluster. This framework incorporates unsupervised clustering cues into the baseline models and identifies plausible chemical subspaces which is compatible with multitask extensions and can serve as model-independent indicators to effectively enhance the performance of multiple downstream tasks. In retrosynthesis prediction, SynCluster achieves significant improvements of 4.1 and 11.0% in top-1 and top-10 prediction accuracy, respectively, compared to the baseline Molecular Transformer, and achieves a notable enhancement of 13.9% in top-10 accuracy when combined with Retroformer.

Partial enolization generates partially enolized photoisomers with a mixture of keto (C=O) and enol (OH) forms, conferring extended \u03c0-conjugation with an increase in electron density. The spatially separated D-A configuration is thus rebuilt with the enol-imine-linked branch as a donor and the keto-enamine-linked branch as an acceptor, and in turn, the photoinduced charges transfer between the two adjacent branches with a long lifetime. We further prove that the partially enolized photoisomer is a key transition instead of the keto-enamine form as an excited-state model to understand the photocatalytic behaviors.

In this study, we aim to link the solvent dependency to the microscopic phenomenon of electron spillover occurring at the metal-solution interface in heterogeneous dielectric media. Addressing the challenge of describing the solvent-modulated electron spillover under constant potential conditions, we adopt a semiclassical functional approach and parametrize it with first-principles calculations and experimental data. We unveil that the key variable governing this phenomenon is the local permittivity within the region approximately 2.5 \u00c5 above the metal edge. A higher local permittivity facilitates the electron spillover that tends to increase the PZC on the one hand and enhances the screening of the electronic charge that tends to decrease the PZC on the other. These dual effect lead to a nonmonotonic relationship between the PZC and the local permittivity. Moreover, our findings reveal that the electron spillover induces a capacitance peak at electrode potentials that are more negative than the PZC in concentrated solutions. This observation contrasts classical models predicting the peak to occur precisely at the PZC. To elucidate the contribution of electron spillover to the total capacitance, we decompose the total capacitance into a quantum capacitance of the metal <i>C</i><sub>q</sub>, a classical capacitance of electrolyte solution <i>C</i><sub>c</sub>, and a capacitance <i>C</i><sub>qc</sub> accounting for electron-ion correlations.

Given that sexually dimorphic facial features, especially more masculine ones, have been previously related to the perception of anger, we investigated the bi-directional influence of emotional expressions and facial masculinity and explored their impact on women's preferences for facial masculinity. We confirmed the effect of facial sexual dimorphism on the perception of emotional cues (happiness and anger) and explored whether smiling or angry expressions influence women's perception of masculinity in male faces. Additionally, we examined women's preferences for emotionally expressive male faces altered along a continuum of masculinity. The results showed that masculinised faces are perceived as angrier, while feminised faces are perceived as happier (Experiment 1), and that angry faces are perceived as more masculine when compared with happy faces (Experiment 2). It is noteworthy that our Experiment 3 uncovered a pivotal finding: women prefer reduced feminisation in happy faces compared with neutral/angry faces. This suggests that the avoidance response observed towards masculinity is attenuated by a smiling expression.

T2DM is a chronic condition caused by reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance. Due to insulin not operating at optimal conditions, blood glucose rises and remains high, thus disturbing metabolic hemostasis. Many complications can arise from T2DM, such as coronary vascular disease, kidney damage, eye damage, and, quite significantly, dementia. It is theorized that dementia from T2DM stems from the fact that the brain is susceptible to hyperglycemic conditions, which are promoted by the increase in insulin resistance of target cells in the central nervous system. This directly affects cognitive processes and memory, which correlates to decreased temporal and front lobes volume. The risk of diabetic complications can be minimized with therapeutic interventions such as oral-antidiabetic (OAD) agents and insulin. Several OADs are on the market, but the first-line agent is metformin, a biguanide that decreases glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity. This paper aims to determine if currently prescribed OADs can help slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk and incidence of dementia as a complication of T2DM. Studies found that, for the most part, all OADs except sulfonylureas (SU) significantly slowed the decline of cognitive function and reduced the risk and incidence of dementia. SU's were shown to increase the risk of dementia in most studies. Of all the OADs, thiazolidinediones may be the most beneficial drug class for reducing the risk of dementia in T2DM patients. Future research should focus on whether early intervention with specific classes of OADs can not only improve glycemic control, leading to decreased hyperglycemia but also prevent the build-up of damaged brain tissue and help to reduce the risk and incidence of dementia in patients with T2DM.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "A Case of Bradycardia, Renal Failure, Atrioventricular Nodal Blockade, Shock, and Hyperkalaemia (BRASH) Syndrome in an Elderly Male and Its Management: A Case Report and Literature Review.", "article_abstract": "BRASH syndrome, characterized by bradycardia, renal dysfunction, atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockage, shock, and hyperkalemia, is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from the interplay between AV nodal blockers and hyperkalemia.

Methods This is a Sparrow Institutional Review Board (IRB)-exempt prospective study that was completed at the Sparrow/Michigan State University (MSU) Family Medicine Residency Program (FMRP) in Michigan between December 2020 and December 2021, involving 40 residents. Assessment of knowledge and confidence in performing OBUS was completed prior to and following the training sessions. For training, an online lecture and two separate hands-on sessions with a pregnant patient were completed. Training materials by Prof. Dr. Mark Deutchman and the University of Washington (UoW) were used. Paired T-test was used for statistical analysis, and a p-value of\u00a0<0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results Thirty-two\u00a0pre- and 25 post-training questionnaires were collected from the target group.

The current advice is therefore to have discussions with the woman on risks to help her make an informed decision about timing, place, and mode of delivery. Obesity is an independent risk factor for pregnancy complications including diabetes, hypertension and macrosomia. In those with these complications, the timing of delivery is often influenced by the severity of the complication. As an independent factor, population based observational studies in obese women have shown an increase in the risk of stillbirth. This risk increases linearly with weight from overweight through to class II obesity, but then rises sharply in those with class III obesity by at least 10-fold beyond 42 weeks when compared to normal weight women. This risk of stillbirth is notably higher in obese women from 34 weeks onwards compared to normal weight women. One modifiable risk factor for stillbirth as shown from various cohorts of pregnant women is prolonged pregnancy. Research has linked obesity to prolonged pregnancy. Although the exact mechanism is yet unknown some have linked this to maternal dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis leading to hormonal imbalance delaying parturition. For these women the two dilemmas are when and how best to deliver. In this review, we examine the evidence and make recommendations on the timing and mode of delivery in women with obesity. For class I obese women there are no differences in outcome with regards to timing and mode of delivery when compared to lean weight women. However, for class II and III obesity, planned induction or caesarean sections may be associated with a lower perinatal morbidity and mortality although this may be associated with an increased in maternal morbidity especially in class III obesity. Studies have shown that delivery by 39 weeks is associated with lower perinatal mortality compared to delivering after in these women. On balance the evidence would favour planned delivery (induction or caesarean section) before 40 weeks of gestation. In the morbidly obese, apart from the standard lower transverse skin incision for CS, there is evidence that a supraumbilical transverse incision may reduce morbidity but is less cosmetic. Irrespective of the option adopted, it is important to discuss the pros and cons of each.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Comments on and illustrations of the WFUMB CEUS liver guidelines: Rare malignant mesenchymal liver lesions.", "article_abstract": "The diagnosis or rare mesenchymal malignant lesions of the liver may be a challenge owing to the rarity of the disease and is usually made by histological confirmation.

Over several months, she developed lumbo-thoracic throbbing pain, which was dermatomal radiating anteriorly. Her pain worsened with activity. A thoracic spine MRI showed a focus of abnormal intradural intramedullary enhancement present from the T10-T11 disc level to the T12-L1 disc level, producing a large amount of edema within the cord.

Chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infections, alcohol abuse, aflatoxin exposure, diabetes, obesity, and tobacco consumption are some of the leading risk factors noted. Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa were noted to have the highest disease burden for HCC, with China representing a considerably large majority.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the diagnostic intricacies of PsA in primary care settings to shed light on the prevalence, barriers, and implications of delayed diagnosis. To achieve our research objectives, we conducted a qualitative synthesis using the meta-ethnographic method, which is a robust approach for synthesizing qualitative data. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for relevant articles using predefined search terms such as \"psoriatic arthritis,\" \"diagnosis,\" and \"primary care.\" The inclusion criteria were narrative articles in English that provided insights into the diagnostic challenges of PsA in primary care. Conference presentations, original articles, and duplicate articles were excluded. Our analysis revealed four key themes that elucidated the multifaceted nature of PsA diagnosis in primary care: (1) a variety of initial and non-specific symptoms, highlighting the diverse clinical presentations that can mimic other conditions; (2) the lack of experience with PsA among primary care professionals, underscoring the importance of education and training; (3) the lack of skin lesions, which can complicate diagnosis when not present; and (4) a delay in diagnosis, with potentially severe consequences for patients' health and quality of life. This study highlights the challenges inherent in the diagnosis of PsA in primary care settings. The multifaceted nature of the disease, coupled with limited experience among primary care providers, often results in delayed diagnosis and subsequent treatment initiation. Early recognition and intervention are pivotal for optimizing patient outcomes. Addressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach involving heightened clinical suspicion, continuous medical education, interdisciplinary collaboration, and utilization of standardized diagnostic criteria.

Each approach was evaluated using a common pine feedstock and the same hydrotreating procedure.

Our research aimed to create a deep-learning model to generate synthetic Ki-67 immunohistochemistry from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images. We used 175 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) from the University Federico II's Pathology Unit's archives to train our model to generate 4 Tissue Micro Arrays (TMAs). We sectioned one slide from each TMA, first stained with H&E and then re-stained with anti-Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC). In digitised slides, cores were disarrayed, and the matching cores of the 2 stained were aligned to construct a dataset to train a Pix2Pix algorithm to convert H&E images to IHC. Pathologists could recognise the synthetic images in only half of the cases in a specially designed likelihood test. Hence, our model produced realistic synthetic images. We next used QuPath to quantify IHC positivity, achieving remarkable levels of agreement between genuine and synthetic IHC. Furthermore, a categorical analysis employing 3 Ki-67 positivity cut-offs (5%, 10%, and 15%) revealed high positive-predictive values.

The antibiogram was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, and a PCR assay was utilized to identify the\u00a0blaTEM<sub>\u00a0</sub>gene responsible for \u03b2-lactamase production. Results Out of 274 processed samples, 65 unique commensal\u00a0<i>Neisseria</i>\u00a0spp. were identified. The study highlighted the presence of the\u00a0blaTEM<i>\u00a0</i>gene in 93.9% (61) of the isolates, which is responsible for \u03b2-lactamase production. All isolates exhibited\u00a0resistance to penicillin. Most\u00a0blaTEM<i>-</i>positive commensal\u00a0<i>Neisseria spp</i>. were susceptible to cefuroxime (83.6%), ceftriaxone (85.2%), and cefotaxime (85.2%). The high prevalence of the\u00a0blaTEM\u00a0gene in commensal\u00a0<i>Neisseria</i>\u00a0is alarming. The gene, found on plasmids, could potentially transfer to other related species like\u00a0<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Neisseria\u00a0meningitidis</i>, as well as other Gram-negative bacilli. Conclusion The presence of resistance genes in commensal bacteria is of concern, as they might be reservoirs for resistance transfer to pathogenic strains. The study emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and deeper investigations into commensal bacteria, emphasizing the need for a broader community screening approach to understand resistance mechanisms in the normal microbiome.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "A Rare and Isolated Presentation of Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma on the Breast.", "article_abstract": "Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma belonging to the CD30+ spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders.

Vaccination efforts have effectively reduced severe outcomes and mortality, but breakthrough infections and new variants are of concern. In response, annual booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being considered to maintain immunity. Healthcare professionals, as frontline workers, play a pivotal role in vaccination campaigns. This study explores their attitudes toward and willingness to accept annual COVID-19 booster doses in India. Methods A pan-India cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare professionals, including faculty, resident doctors, interns, and nursing staff, across Indian medical and nursing colleges. Convenience sampling was used to collect responses via an online questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed demographics, vaccine status, attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination, and willingness to accept annual booster doses. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of booster dose acceptance. Results A total of 535 participants responded from 28 states and 8 union territories of India. Most were 34.2 years (\u00b1 11.1 SD), and 372 (69.5%) had taken Covishield (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) as their primary vaccine. While 525 (98.1%) had taken the first dose and 518 (96.8%) of them had taken the second dose, only 333 (62.2%) had received a booster. Around 318 (60%) of healthcare professionals were willing to accept an annual booster dose. The mean attitude score toward annual booster doses was 75.4 (range: 28-111). Healthcare professionals' trust in government recommendations and medical experts significantly influenced their willingness to accept annual booster doses. Conclusion This study provides insights into the attitudes of healthcare professionals in India toward annual COVID-19 booster doses.

Gross examination showed a well-circumscribed pink soft mass measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm. The entire lesion was submitted for histologic evaluation, demonstrating a neoplasm with branching stroma and exuberant squamous differentiation. The lesion exhibited obvious cytologic features of malignancy like mitotic figures, prominent nucleoli, irregular nuclei, and multinucleation. Collagen IV stain ruled out invasion. The lesion was finally classified as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ with the configuration of an intraductal papilloma. The possibility of metastatic disease was suggested.\u00a0A PET scan was negative, and no other foci of disease were found in the remainder of the specimen.

Methodology This analytical cross-sectional study used an online pre-validated questionnaire and was conducted from July to August 2023. The target population included physicians working in primary healthcare (PHC) daily clinics in Makkah. Results A total of 153 participants were included in the current study. Of which 90 (58.8%) were females and 120 (78.4%) participants had chicken pox history. Around 123 (80.4%) had previously heard about shingles. The most reported source of information was physicians (63%) followed by the Internet (12.2%). Risk factors for shingles were found to be immunodeficiency (95.1%) and age (78%). Most (88.2%) participants had previously heard about the shingles vaccine and 99 (64.7%) reported that the shingles vaccine is needed even if the patient had chicken pox in the past. Most participants (82.4%) knew that the vaccine should be given to adults aged more than 50 years. About 69 (45.1%) thought that they were extremely likely to get the shingles vaccine if the doctor recommended it. Barriers to shingles vaccination among study participants included participant's perception that they were not at risk of getting shingles (33%) and concerns about vaccines' side effects (27.5%). The average knowledge score about shingles was found to be 9.51 \u00b1 3.14 and the average knowledge score about shingles vaccine was found to be 5.43 \u00b1 1.46.

Axial chromatic aberration is corrected by a refractive phase mask that introduces pure defocus into one beam, while lateral chromatic aberration is corrected by a piezoelectric mirror that dynamically compensates for lateral shifts during scanning. We show that this light-efficient approach allows seamless chromatic correction over the entire field of view of different multiphoton objectives without compromising spatial and temporal resolution and that the effective area for beam-mixing processes can be increased by more than 1 order of magnitude.

These methods offer a standardized solution to the frequently subjective challenge of image interpretation.This subjectivity is most desirable in bone metastasis imaging. This review describes the basic imaging modalities of bone metastasis imaging, along with the recent developments and current applications of AI in the respective imaging studies. These concrete examples emphasize the importance of using computer-aided systems in the clinical setting. The review culminates with an examination of the current limitations and prospects of AI in the realm of bone metastasis imaging.

PDT is applied as an effective tool with minimal side effects against tumor tissues. This study aimed to assess the targets of critical genes by PDT at the cellular level of cancer to provide a new perspective on its molecular mechanism. <b>Methods:</b> To assess the effect of PDT, we extracted the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the gene expression profiles of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with PDT from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The queried DEGs were evaluated via a regulatory network and gene ontology enrichment to find the critical targets. <b>Results:</b> Among 76 queried significant DEGs, 27 individuals were interacted by activation, inhibition, and co-expression actions. Thirty DEGs were related to the five classes of biological terms. The IL-17 signaling pathway and PTGS2, CXCL8, FOS, JUN, CXCL1, ZFP36, and FOSB were identified as the crucial targets of PDT. <b>Conclusion:</b> PDT as a stimulator of gene expression and an activator of gene activity overexpressed and hyper-activated many genes.

The groups were compared based on their diets: cow manure only or cow manure mixed with varying amounts of coir pith. The aim was to assess the effects of coir pith on earthworm growth, mortality and the microbial community involved in vermicomposting. Earthworms fed with higher proportions of coir pith (70\u00a0% w/w) experienced reduced growth (0.81\u00a0g/worm) and increased mortality (24.67\u00a0%) after 5 weeks of vermicomposting. These effects were attributed to the high level of total phenolic content in the system. Coir pith required specific bacteria for digestion and detoxification, and excessive intake disrupted the earthworms' digestion, thus hindering nutrient absorption. The study also examined the microbial composition of the vermicast samples and identified variations based on the diet. Bacterial taxa involved in lignocellulose degradation, such as Bacteriodota, <i>Azospirillum</i>, Chitinophagaceae, <i>Marinomonas</i> and <i>Pantoea</i>, exhibited decreased abundances in treatments with coir pith.

The Health Recommendation System (HRS) has become an essential mechanism for medical care. In this sense, efficient healthcare networks are critical for medical decision-making processes. The fundamental purpose is to maintain that sensitive information can be shared only at the right moment while guaranteeing the effectiveness of data, authenticity, security, and legal concerns.

Also, we experimentally explored if the H4K20me3 was upregulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributed to tumor progression in HCC cell lines. We found that H4K20me3 level was increased in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 levels were also increased in HCC tissues. Cox regression analysis revealed that the elevated H4K20me3 level was associated with tumor recurrence and short survival in HCC patients. Experimentally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> provoked oxidative stress and induced H4K20me3 formation in HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

We developed a reliable synthetic protocol toward dideutero-nirmatrelvir and its homologated analogues with high isotopic incorporation. Deuteration of the primary metabolic site of nirmatrelvir provides a 3-fold improvement of its human microsomal stability but is accompanied by an increased metabolism rate at secondary sites. Homologation of the lactam ring allows the capping group modification to decrease and delocalize the molecule's lipophilicity, reducing the metabolic rate at secondary sites. The effect of deuteration was less pronounced for the 6-membered lactam than for its 5-membered analogue in human microsomes, but the trend is reversed in the case of mouse microsomes.

Low-cost oxygen carriers are especially relevant for the conversion of solid fuels, which may contain large amounts of reactive ashes. Ash may limit the lifetime of the bed material, which is why a high-cost oxygen carrier will likely not be competitive. Applying LD slag on an industrial scale as an oxygen carrier makes the storage properties of the material highly interesting. LD slag has been known to be affected by weathering, thus limiting the possibilities of the material to be used in construction, e.g., as fillers in concrete. In this study, pretreated LD slag for use as an oxygen carrier was weathered outdoors for roughly 1.5 years in southwest Sweden. Afterward, the particles were characterized and used in a laboratory batch fluidized bed reactor system to evaluate the effects of storage on the oxygen carrier properties. It was found that the reactivity with the fuel of the weathered LD slag was similar to that of the original sample when used in a laboratory fluidized bed. However, the physical properties were severely degraded due to weathering. Dissolved CaO formed CaCO<sub>3</sub>, agglomerating the top layer of the sample. The particles in the bulk of the sample were found to have decreased density and increased attrition rate. This suggests that LD slag particles for use as oxygen carriers should be stored dry to avoid weathering of the particles.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Peripartum Hysterectomy Outcomes: Our Eleven-Year Experience at a Tertiary Care Hospital.", "article_abstract": "To investigate the outcomes of peripartum hysterectomies (PHs) conducted to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality at a tertiary care hospital with 15,000 deliveries per year.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "02"}}, {"article_title": "Pulmonary Immune-Related Adverse Events of PD-1 Versus PD-L1 Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Retrospective Review of Pharmacovigilance.", "article_abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapeutics.

Unfortunately, approximately 10-15% of patients have no response to treatment or have recurrence at a short interval following radiotherapy. The introduction of immunotherapy in the form of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in metastatic colorectal cancer has improved clinical outcomes, yet most patients with RC present with microsatellite stable disease, which lacks the immune-rich microenvironment where ICB is most effective. There is evidence that combining radiotherapy with ICB can unlock the mechanisms that drive resistance in patients; however, the sequencing of these therapies is still debated. This review offers a comprehensive overview of clinical trials and preclinical models that use radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in RC in an attempt to extrapolate the ideal sequencing of the two treatment modalities.

A surgical procedure triggers a physiological stress response, which culminates in insulin resistance by activating the sympathetic autonomic system. The impact of fluid management in the perioperative period on the glycemic variation of patients has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods This study, which included 42 non-diabetic patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries, was an observational, prospective cohort study. The sample was split into two groups according to the type of fluid used intraoperatively: polyelectrolyte and 5% glucose polyelectrolyte. Results No significant differences were found between the groups in demographic and baseline data, including age, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status. There were no differences in glycemic variation between the two groups. Blood glucose varied over time with statistical significance in the perioperative period but with no difference between the two groups.

However, since there is no report on the investigation in Japan, we investigated foreign amylases in 67 commercial honeys in Japan. First, the \u03b1-glucosidase and diastase activities of honeys were measured, which revealed that only \u03b1-glucosidase activity was significantly low in several samples. As both enzymes are secreted from honeybee glands, it is unlikely that only one enzyme was inactivated during processing. Therefore, we suspected the presence of foreign amylase. \u03b1-Amylase in honey were assigned using protein analysis software based on LC-QTOF-MS. As a result, \u03b1-amylases from <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Geobacillus</i> were detected in 13 and 6 out of 67 honeys, respectively. To detect foreign amylases easily, we developed a cost-effective method using native PAGE. Conventional native PAGE failed to separate the \u03b1-amylase derived from honeybee and <i>Geobacillus</i>. However, when native PAGE was performed using a gel containing 1 % maltodextrin, the \u03b1-amylase from honeybee did not migrated in the gel and the \u03b1-amylase could be separated from the other two \u03b1-amylases.

Rural identifiers are also less likely to support pro-LGBT policy measures than nonrural identifiers. Nevertheless, I find the magnitude of the effects of rural identity on anti-LGBT views to be surprisingly small.

The basic pathophysiology behind the M-protein presence is the proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow or extramedullary sites and is assessed using cytomorphology and immunophenotyping. The role of multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) for PC identification is technically the most valuable tool in this context as it characterizes as well as quantifies the clonal PCs based on differential expression of various immunophenotypic (IPT) markers. From a diagnostic perspective, MFC is critical in the definite identification of the clonal PCs and delineates benign and borderline entities at one end of the spectrum (MGUS, SMM) with lower clonal PC% and, malignant diseases at the other end (MM and PCL) with higher clonal PC fraction. The role of MFC in assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) and monitoring of progression in MM and various PCPDs has been validated in multiple clinical studies and is probably one of the most promising tools for predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, MFC also plays a crucial role in disease prognostication based on specific IPT profiles. An additional role of MFC in the current clinical scenario is the evaluation of tumor microenvironment based on immune cell repertoire, which is reflecting encouraging results across.

Recent studies have shown that repeated use of the same task-relevant item in WM results in a hand-off of the storage of that item to LTM, and switching to a new item reactivates WM. To further elucidate the rules governing WM-LTM interactions, we here planned to probe whether a change in task rules, independent of a switch in task-relevant items, would also lead to WM reactivation of maintained items. To this end, we used scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data, specifically the contralateral delay activity (CDA), to track WM item storage while manipulating repetitions and changes in task rules and task-relevant items across trials in a visual WM task. We tested two rival hypotheses: If changes in task rules result in a reactivation of the target item representation, then the CDA should increase when a task change is cued even when the same target has been repeated across trials. However, if the reactivation of a task-relevant item only depends on the mnemonic availability of the item itself instead of the task it is used for, then only the changes in task-relevant items should reactivate the representations. Accordingly, the CDA amplitude should decrease for repeated task-relevant items independently of a task change. We found a larger CDA on task-switch compared to task-repeat trials, suggesting that the reactivation of task rules triggers the reactivation of task-relevant items in WM. By demonstrating that WM reactivation of LTM is interdependent for task rules and task-relevant items, this study informs our understanding of visual WM and its interplay with LTM.

However, the emphasis on increasing body weight has led to a rise in the proportion of rapidly shrinking fibers, adversely affecting the quality and shelf life of poultry meat. With a growing awareness of dietetics among consumers, there is an increasing challenge to produce chicken meat that is not only free of antibiotics but also beneficial for dietary and health reasons. Biogenic amines (BA) can serve as indicators of meat freshness and quality. While they play vital roles in the body, excessive consumption of BA can have toxic and carcinogenic effects. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of supplementing feed with garlic extract and \u03b2-alanine (\u03b2-Ala) on the formation of BA and amino acid (AA) levels in the breast and leg muscles of chickens stored under aerobic chilling conditions. The muscles were obtained from chickens fed with garlic extract and \u03b2-Ala in quantities of 0.5 and 2% for each additive, as well as 0.5 and 2% of their combination. Analyses were conducted on d 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 of storage. \u03b2-Ala supplementation increased the proportion of this AA in breast (P < 0.01) and leg muscles (P < 0.01), along with a rise in the proportion of nonessential AA (NEAA; sum of aspartic, aspartic acid, glutamic, glutamic acid, serine, \u03b2-Ala, and proline) (P < 0.01).

Following infection, we assessed the clinical course of disease progression at days 1 and 3 post-challenge and evaluated viral tropism and immune analytes. The results demonstrated that RVFV infection was affected by the cell line used to propagate the challenge virus, with those grown in insect cells resulting in a more rapid disease progression. The lowest dose that caused uniform severe disease remained the same across both virus preparations. In addition, to demonstrate reproducibility, the lowest dose was used for a subsequent infection study using male and female animals.

The aim of this work was to determine the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in a Mexican hospital after six months of the administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (two doses, 4 weeks apart) and to investigate the association between comorbidities, response to the vaccine, and reinfections. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were determined using ELISA assays for 262 employees of Hospital Ju\u00e1rez de M\u00e9xico with and without a history of COVID-19. A beta regression analysis was performed to study the associated comorbidities and their relationship with the levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

The spleen plays a very important part in protecting hosts against infectious pathogens. In this research, transcriptome and translatome sequencing technology were combined to investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional and translational regulation in the spleen after ARV infection. On a genome-wide scale, ARV infection can significantly reduce the translation efficiency (TE) of splenic genes. Differentially expressed translational efficiency genes (DTEGs) were identified, including 15 upregulated DTEGs and 396 downregulated DTEGs. These DTEGs were mainly enriched in immune regulation signaling pathways, which indicates that ARV infection reduces the innate immune response in the spleen. In addition, combined analyses revealed that the innate immune response involves the effects of transcriptional and translational regulation. Moreover, we discovered the key gene IL4I1, the most significantly upregulated gene at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Further studies in DF1 cells showed that overexpression of IL4I1 could inhibit the replication of ARV, while inhibiting the expression of endogenous IL4I1 with siRNA promoted the replication of ARV. Overexpression of IL4I1 significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2, LGP2, TBK1 and NF-\u03baB; however, the expression of these genes was significantly upregulated after inhibition of IL4I1, suggesting that IL4I1 may be a negative feedback effect of innate immune signaling pathways. In addition, there may be an interaction between IL4I1 and ARV \u03c3A protein, and we speculate that the IL4I1 protein plays a regulatory role by interacting with the \u03c3A protein. This study not only provides a new perspective on the regulatory mechanisms of the innate immune response after ARV infection but also enriches the knowledge of the host defense mechanisms against ARV invasion and the outcome of ARV evasion of the host's innate immune response.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Diagnostic Efficacy of Serological Antibody Detection Tests for Hepatitis Delta Virus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.", "article_abstract": "Background and Aims Coinfection of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes the most severe form of viral hepatitis, and the global prevalence of HDV infection is underestimated.

Forty-three articles reporting equine IAV vaccination and challenge studies in previously na\u00efve equids using an appropriate comparison group were included in a qualitative analysis of vaccine efficacy.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length E2 sequence shows that the virus is closely related to CSF virus (CSFV) genotype 2.6 strains circulating in Southeast Asia. The pathotyping experiment suggests that the virus responsible is a moderately virulent strain. The 190 nucleotide stretch of the E2 hypervariable region of these isolates also shows high similarity to the CSFV isolates from Colombia in 2005 and 2006, suggesting a common origin for the CSF outbreaks caused by genotype 2.6 strains. The emergence of genotype 2.6 in Colombia suggests a potential transboundary spread of CSFV from Asia to the Americas, complicating the ongoing CSF eradication efforts in the Americas, and emphasizes the need for continuous surveillance in the region.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "The Secondary Structure of Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid Determines Its Infectivity in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.", "article_abstract": "The function of RNAs is determined by their structure. However, studying the relationship between RNA structure and function often requires altering RNA sequences to modify the structures, which leads to the neglect of the importance of RNA sequences themselves. In our research, we utilized potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), a circular-form non-coding infectious RNA, as a model with which to investigate the role of a specific rod-like structure in RNA function. By generating linear RNA transcripts with different start sites, we established 12 PSTVd forms with different secondary structures while maintaining the same sequence. The RNA secondary structures were predicted using the mfold tool and validated through native PAGE gel electrophoresis after in vitro RNA folding. Analysis using plant infection assays revealed that the formation of a correct rod-like structure is crucial for the successful infection of PSTVd. Interestingly, the inability of PSTVd forms with non-rod-like structures to infect plants could be partially compensated by increasing the amount of linear viroid RNA transcripts, suggesting the existence of additional RNA secondary structures, such as the correct rod-like structure, alongside the dominant structure in the RNA inoculum of these forms.

The developed model made it possible to simulate the spread of three types of strain of the COVID-19 virus, and to analyze the adequacy of this model in the case of unhindered spread of the virus among city residents. Calculations based on the proposed model show that SARS-CoV 2 spreads mainly from contacts in workplaces and transport, and schoolchildren and preschool children are the recipients, not the initiators of the epidemic. The simulations showed that fluctuations in the dynamics of various indicators of the spread of SARS-CoV 2 were associated with the difference in the daily schedule on weekdays and weekends. The results of the calculations showed that the daily schedules of people strongly influence the spread of SARS-CoV 2. Under assumptions of the model, the results show that for the more contagious \"rapid\" strains of SARS-CoV 2 (omicron), immunocompetent people become a significant source of infection. For the less contagious \"slow strains\" (alpha) of SARS-CoV 2, the most active source of infection is immunocompromised individuals (pregnant women).

Typically, the infections start in the mucosal epithelia, from which the viral particles invade the axons of the peripheral nervous system. In the nuclei of the peripheral ganglia, \u03b1-HVs establish a lifelong latency and eventually undergo multiple reactivation cycles. Upon reactivation, viral progeny can move into the nerves, back out toward the periphery where they entered the organism, or they can move toward the central nervous system (CNS). This latency-reactivation cycle is remarkably well controlled by the intricate actions of the intrinsic and innate immune responses of the host, and finely counteracted by the viral proteins in an effort to co-exist in the population. If this yin-yang- or Nash-equilibrium-like balance state is broken due to immune suppression or genetic mutations in the host response factors particularly in the CNS, or the presence of other pathogenic stimuli, \u03b1-HV reactivations might lead to life-threatening pathologies.

Vaccine hesitancy was identified in our study in 47.28% of the participants (191 of the 404 mothers included). Most of them come from an urban environment (57.59%), have university and post-secondary education (58.64%) and are prim parous (58.64%). The behavior of participants from GNV is influenced by a low level of knowledge and information regarding vaccination and by concerns related to adverse reactions, new vaccines and the number of vaccines administered. Also, this group is characterized by an increased perception of the risks related to vaccination, while the perception of the risks associated with the disease is low. For all subscales, important differences were registered between the two groups in favor of GPV, a group characterized by positive attitudes and perceptions and a better level of knowledge compared to GNV. This study aims to represent a starting point for the organization and running of information campaigns regarding vaccination at the level of Bihor County, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage, where this behavior is identified.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Attitudes toward COVID-19 and Other Vaccines: Comparing Parents to Other Adults, September 2022.", "article_abstract": "Few analyses of COVID-19 vaccine attitudes also cover routine vaccines or focus on parents.

Our aim was to assess the dose accuracy and stability of TMZ using capsule contents mixed with food compared with a novel, ready-to-use liquid formulation specifically developed for children (Ped-TMZ, brand name KIZFIZO). Dose accuracy and TMZ stability testing were performed with TMZ capsule contents (90 mg) mixed with food vehicles (apple juice, apple sauce, cream, milk, and mashed potatoes) and compared to an equivalent dose of Ped-TMZ. Acceptance criteria were predefined for TMZ (95.0-105.0%) and its degradation product amino-imidazole-carboxamide (AIC; <1%) content. The delivered dose was significantly higher using Ped-TMZ (96.6 \u00b1 1.2%) and within the predefined criteria for TMZ content, whereas it was systematically under the lower specifications of 95% using capsule-derived preparations with apple juice (91.0 \u00b1 1.5%) and apple sauce (91.6 \u00b1 1.4%), respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.0001).

Curcumin was loaded in PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil and puronic F127 mixed nanomicelles (Cur-RH60/F127-MMs). Cur-RH60/F127-MMs was prepared using the thin film dispersion method. The morphology and releasing characteristics of nanomicelles were evaluated. The uptake and permeability of Cur-RH60/F127-MMs were investigated using RAW264.7 and Caco-2 cells, and their bioavailability and in vivo/vitro anti-inflammatory activity were also evaluated. The results showed that Cur-RH60/F127-MMs have regular sphericity, possess an average diameter smaller than 20 nm, and high encapsulation efficiency for curcumin (89.43%). Cur-RH60/F127-MMs significantly increased the cumulative release of curcumin in vitro and uptake by cells (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The oral bioavailability of Cur-RH60/F127-MMs was much higher than that of curcumin-active pharmaceutical ingredients (Cur-API) (about 9.24-fold).

First, the miscibility and interaction between the drug and polymer were investigated as pre-formulation strategies using various analytical approaches to obtain information for selecting a suitable polymer. Based on the calculation of the Hansen solubility parameter and the identification of the single glass transition temperature (Tg), the miscibility between bisacodyl and all the investigated polymers was confirmed. Additionally, the drug-polymer molecular interaction was identified based on the comprehensive results of dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, and a comparison of the predicted and experimental values of Tg. In particular, the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-based solid dispersions, which exhibited large deviation between the calculated and experimental values of Tg and superior physical stability after DVS experiments, were selected as the most appropriate solubilized bisacodyl formulations due to the excellent inhibitory effects on precipitation based on the results of the non-sink dissolution test. Furthermore, it was shown that the enteric-coated tablets containing HPMC-bisacodyl at a 1:4 ratio (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>) had significantly improved in vivo therapeutic laxative efficacy compared to preparations containing un-solubilized raw bisacodyl in constipation-induced rabbits.

The quantitative synthesis yielded a pooled detection rate of 99% for primary HNC lesions. Additionally, on a per patient-based analysis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for regional lymph node metastases were found to be 90% and 84%, respectively. The analysis revealed a statistical heterogeneity among the studies for the detection rate of primary HNC lesions. The quantitative findings presented in this study indicate a favorable diagnostic performance of FAP-targeted PET imaging in detecting primary HNC tumors. In contrast, discordant results concerning the diagnostic accuracy of lymph node metastases were found. However, further multicentric trials are required to validate the efficacy of FAP-targeted PET in this specific group of patients.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Novel Anthranilic Acid Hybrids-An Alternative Weapon against Inflammatory Diseases.", "article_abstract": "Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation while protecting the cardiovascular system. However, the side effects of currently available medications have limited their usage. Due to these adverse effects, there is a significant need for new drugs. The current trend of research has shifted towards the synthesis of novel anthranilic acid hybrids as anti-inflammatory agents. Phenyl- or benzyl-substituted hybrids exerted very good anti-inflammatory effects in preventing albumin denaturation. To confirm their anti-inflammatory effects, additional ex vivo tests were conducted. These immunohistochemical studies explicated the same compounds with better anti-inflammatory potential. To determine the binding affinity and interaction mode, as well as to explain the anti-inflammatory activities, the molecular docking simulation of the compounds was investigated against human serum albumin. The biological evaluation of the compounds was completed, assessing their antimicrobial activity and spasmolytic effect. Based on the experimental data, we can conclude that a collection of novel hybrids was successfully synthesized, and they can be considered anti-inflammatory drug candidates-alternatives to current therapeutics.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Triphenylphosphine Derivatives of Allylbenzenes Express Antitumor and Adjuvant Activity When Solubilized with Cyclodextrin-Based Formulations.", "article_abstract": "Allylbenzenes (apiol, dillapiol, myristicin and allyltetramethoxybenzene) are individual components of plant essential oils that demonstrate antitumor activity and can enhance the antitumor activity of cytotoxic drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin, etc. Triphenylphosphine (PPh<sub>3</sub>) derivatives of allylbenzenes are two to three orders of magnitude more potent than original allylbenzenes in terms of IC<sub>50</sub>. The inhibition of efflux pumps has been reported for allylbenzenes, and the PPh<sub>3</sub> moiety is deemed to be responsible for preferential mitochondrial accumulation and the depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. However, due to poor solubility, the practical use of these substances has never been an option. Here, we show that this problem can be solved by using a complex formation with cyclodextrin (CD-based molecular containers) and polyanionic heparin, stabilizing the positive charge of the PPh<sub>3</sub> cation. Such containers can solubilize both allylbenzenes and their PPh<sub>3</sub> derivatives up to 0.4 mM concentration. Furthermore, we have observed that solubilized PPh<sub>3</sub> derivatives indeed work as adjuvants, increasing the antitumor activity of paclitaxel against adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) by an order of magnitude (in terms of IC50) in addition to being quite powerful cytostatics themselves (IC<sub>50</sub> in the range 1-10 \u00b5M). Even more importantly, CD-solubilized PPh<sub>3</sub> derivatives show pronounced selectivity, being highly toxic for the A549 tumor cell line and minimally toxic for HEK293T non-tumor cells, red blood cells and sea urchin embryos. Indeed, in many cancers, the mitochondrial membrane is more prone to depolarization compared to normal cells, which probably explains the observed selectivity of our compounds, since PPh<sub>3</sub> derivatives are known to act as mitochondria-targeting agents. According to the MTT test, 100 \u00b5M solution of PPh<sub>3</sub> derivatives of allylbenzenes causes the death of up to 85% of A549 cancer cells, while for HEK293T non-cancer cells, only 15-20% of the cells died. The hemolytic index of the studied substances did not exceed 1%, and the thrombogenicity index was < 1.5%. Thus, this study outlines the experimental foundation for developing combined cytostatic medications, where effectiveness and selectivity are achieved through decreased concentration of the primary ingredient and the inclusion of adjuvants, which are safe or practically harmless substances.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "26"}}, {"article_title": "Antimicrobial Activity of Ceragenins against Vancomycin-Susceptible and -Resistant <i>Enterococcus</i> spp.", "article_abstract": "Ceragenins (CSAs) are a new class of antimicrobial agents designed to mimic the activities of endogenous antimicrobial peptides. In this study, the antibacterial activities of various ceragenins (CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-90, CSA-131, CSA-138, CSA-142, and CSA-192), linezolid, and daptomycin were assessed against 50 non-repeated <i>Enterococcus</i> spp. (17 of them vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus-VRE) isolated from various clinical specimens. Among the ceragenins evaluated, the MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> values of CSA-44 and CSA-192 were the lowest (2 and 4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively), and further studies were continued with these two ceragenins. Potential interactions between CSA-44 or CSA-192 and linezolid were tested and synergistic interactions were seen with the CSA-192-linezolid combination against three <i>Enterococcus</i> spp., one of them VRE. The effects of CSA-44 and CSA-192 on the MIC values of vancomycin were also investigated, and the largest MIC change was seen in the vancomycin-CSA-192 combination. The in vivo effects of CSA-44 and CSA-192 were evaluated in a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model system. Compared to no treatment, increased survival was observed with <i>C. elegans</i> when treated with ceragenins. In conclusion, CSA-44 and CSA-192 appear to be good candidates (alone or in combination) for the treatment of enterococcal infections, including those from VRE.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "23"}}, {"article_title": "Comparative Assessment and High-Throughput Drug-Combination Profiling of TEAD-Palmitoylation Inhibitors in Hippo Pathway Deficient Mesothelioma.", "article_abstract": "The hippo signaling pathway is a central tumor suppressor cascade frequently inactivated in selected human cancers, leading to the aberrant activation of TEAD transcription factors. Whereas several TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitors are currently in development, a comprehensive assessment of this novel drug-modality is missing. Here, we report a comparative analysis among six TEADi(s) using cell-based and biochemical assays in Hippo pathway deficient mesothelioma. Our analysis revealed varying potency and selectivity across TEADi, also highlighting their limited efficacy. To overcome this limitation, we performed an unbiased, quantitative high-throughput drug screening by combining the TEADi VT-103 with a library of approximately 3000 oncology-focused drugs. By exploiting this library's mechanistic redundancy, we identified several drug-classes robustly synergized with TEADi. These included glucocorticoid-receptor (GR) agonists, Mek1/2 inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and PI3K inhibitors, among others. Altogether, we report a coherent single-agent dataset informing on potency and selectivity of TEAD-palmitoylation inhibitors as single-agents. We also describe a rational pipeline enabling the systematic identification of TEAD druggable co-dependencies. This data should support the pre-clinical development of drug combination strategies for the treatment of Hippo-deficient mesothelioma, and more broadly, for other cancers dependent on the oncogenic activity of YAP/TEAD.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "11", "day": "21"}}]
